# unibo-dtm-ml-2526-cervical-cancer-predictor

## Project Overview
This ML project revolves around the prediction of indicators/diagnosis of cervical cancer.   

## Dataset Description
The dataset to be used for the project was taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and it was originally collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. It comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients. Additionally, the results of the 4 diagnostic tests related to the matter (Hinselmann, Schiller, Citology, Biopsy) are featured for each sample in the dataset. Missing values do exist, as several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns. 

## ML Task Definition
The specific goal of the project is to make the ML model predict the results of the aforementioned 4 diagnostic tests and, in order to do this, a multi-label binary classification task will be carried out through the main ML techniques: logistic regression (one vs rest), random forest, XGBoost, SVM, multi-label k-NN, and multilabel NNs eventually (to be included only if results are satisfying).
